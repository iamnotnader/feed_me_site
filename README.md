Ordering food is sucks because there are too many choices. First you have to
pick a restaurant, and THEN you have to figure out if any of its dishes are
actually worth eating. Why pick a restaurant at all?

FoodMe shows you full ready-made dishes, one at a time, and you choose them just
by swiping. It's so fun and simple you'll use it every day.
