Deciding what to eat is painful because there isn't an efficient way to sift through all the choices. First, you have to pick a restaurant, and then even after you've done that, you still need to choose which dish to get.

All prices in FoodMe have the tax, tip, and delivery fee included so literally the only thing you need to do is swipe, then hit a button.
