        <p>Deciding what to eat is painful because there isn't an efficient way to sift
          through all the choices. First, you have to pick a restaurant, and then even
          after you've done that, you <em>still</em> need to choose which dish to get.
        </p>

        <p>
          FoodMe solves this problem by taking you straight to choosing your meal,
          without overwhelming you with choices. Just swipe through our selection of
          fully-prepared meals, and order up! All prices in FoodMe have the tax, tip,
          and delivery fee included so literally the only thing you need to do is swipe,
          then hit a button.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's so easy even Burgie can do it!
